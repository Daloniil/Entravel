# Application Development Plan: Flight Search System

## 1. Project Setup and Initial Configuration

This phase focuses on setting up the basic development environment and project structure.

- **1.1 Initialize React Project with TypeScript:**
  - Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite with TypeScript template.
  - Configure `tsconfig.json` for strict type checking and appropriate React settings.
- **1.2 Version Control Setup:**
  - Initialize a Git repository.
  - Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, build artifacts).
  - Make the initial commit.
- **1.3 Basic Styling Setup:**
  - Use Styled Components for styling.
- **1.4 Routing Setup:**
  - Install `react-router-dom` for handling URL synchronization and navigation.

## 2. Core Feature Implementation: Search Bar

This phase implements the main search bar functionality and its associated UI elements.

- **2.1 Search Bar Component Structure:**
  - Design and implement the main `SearchBar` component.
  - Break down the `SearchBar` into smaller, reusable components for each input field (e.g., `FlightTypeSelector`, `FlightClassSelector`, `DestinationInput`, `DateRangePicker`, `PassengerSelector`).
- **2.2 Flight Type Selection:**
  - Implement `Round-trip` / `One-way` toggle.
  - Conditionally render the return date input based on flight type.
- **2.3 Flight Class Selection:**
  - Implement `Economy` / `Business` / `First` dropdown or radio buttons.
- **2.4 Destination Input with Autocomplete:**
  - Google Flights locations API.
  - Implement an autocomplete dropdown for `From` and `To` fields.
  - Handle API calls, debouncing, and displaying suggestions.
- **2.5 Date Selection:**
  - Implement a date picker component for `Departure` and `Return` dates.
  - Ensure `Return` date is only active for `Round-trip`.
- **2.6 Passenger Selection:**
  - Implement input fields or steppers for `Adults`, `Children`, and `Infants`.
- **2.7 Search Button:**
  - Implement a functional search button that triggers flight results display.

## 3. State Management and URL Synchronization

This phase addresses how the application state is managed and synchronized with the browser URL.

- **3.1 State Management Strategy:**
  - Choose a state management solution. Given the requirements, a combination of React Context API for global search state and `useState`/`useReducer` for local component state seems appropriate. Redux or Zustand could be overkill for this specific task unless the application scales significantly. I will propose using React Context for the main search parameters.
- **3.2 URL Synchronization:**
  - Implement a custom hook (e.g., `useSearchParamsSync`) to read and write search parameters to the browser URL.
  - Ensure that changes in the search bar update the URL, and changes in the URL update the search bar state.
  - Parse URL parameters on initial load to restore the search configuration.

## 4. Flight Results Display

This phase handles displaying mock flight results.

- **4.1 Mock Flight Data Service:**
  - Create a service or utility function that simulates fetching flight data based on search parameters. This function should return a predefined set of mock results.
- **4.2 Results Display Component:**
  - Implement a `FlightResults` component to display the fetched mock data.
  - Show a loading indicator while "fetching" results.

## 5. Architecture Design: White-label and Dependency Injection

### 5.1 White-label Architecture

To support a white-label approach, the application needs a modular and extensible structure.

- **5.1.1 Configuration-driven Components:**
  - Design components to accept configurations (props) that allow for client-specific variations.
  - Use a `config` object or context to provide client-specific settings (e.g., `features.extraSearchOptions`, `banners.announcementText`).
- **5.1.2 Component Overrides/Extensions:**
  - Implement a mechanism for clients to override or extend specific components. This could involve:
    - **Prop-based customization:** Passing custom render functions or components as props.
    - **Component Slotting:** Using `children` or specific props to inject custom content.
    - **Higher-Order Components (HOCs) or Render Props:** To wrap or modify existing components.
    - **Feature Flags:** To enable/disable client-specific features.
- **5.1.3 Theming:**
  - Implement a theming solution (e.g., CSS variables, Styled Components `ThemeProvider`) to allow clients to customize the look and feel.

### 5.2 Dependency Injection (DI)

DI can be applied to make services and external dependencies easily swappable and testable.

- **5.2.1 Identifying DI Candidates:**
  - **API Services:** The destination autocomplete API service, and the mock flight results fetching service are prime candidates. Different clients might use different APIs or mock data sources.
  - **Configuration:** Client-specific configurations can be injected.
  - **Logger:** If logging is implemented, a logger service could be injected.
- **5.2.2 Implementation Strategy:**
  - **React Context API:** For injecting services and configurations into the component tree. This is a natural fit for React applications.
  - **Custom Hooks:** To abstract the consumption of injected dependencies.

## 6. Code Quality and Performance

This phase focuses on ensuring the code is clean, maintainable, and performs well.

- **6.1 Clean Code Practices:**
  - Follow consistent naming conventions.
  - Write clear, concise, and well-commented code.
  - Adhere to ESLint and Prettier rules.
- **6.2 Performance Optimizations:**
  - Use `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Debounce API calls for autocomplete.
  - Lazy load components if the application grows.
- **6.3 Type Safety:**
  - Leverage TypeScript extensively for strong typing across all components, props, state, and services.

## 7. Deployment and Delivery

This phase covers the final steps for delivering the solution.

- **7.1 GitHub Repository:**
  - Create a public GitHub repository.
  - Push the entire codebase.
  - Add `leetio-varsha` as a collaborator.
- **7.2 Deployment to GitHub Pages:**
  - Configure the project for deployment to GitHub Pages (e.g., using `gh-pages` package or GitHub Actions).
  - Provide clear instructions in the `README.md` on how to run the project locally and access the deployed version.
- **7.3 Documentation:**
  - Update `README.md` with:
    - Project description.
    - Setup instructions (installation, running locally).
    - Explanation of architecture (white-label, DI).
    - Explanation of state management.
    - Link to the deployed application.
